Dear Reviewer

Thanks for taking your time, and I hope you enjoy it.
I think the app turned out very well, how it looks and feels. 
This is also thanks to the provided assets from your side. 
It was a fun assignment to work on, didn't have time to finish everything tho.

I would have liked to create a small "unboxing" game where you get a random pokemon from a pokeball.

Also code wise I didn't leave everything super clean.
There are some inconsistenciese, and tests are missing.
Although I think what I am going for is clear to see.
